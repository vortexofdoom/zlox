#zlox

A Zig implementation of the Lox bytecode interpreter from Robert Nystrom's [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com)

## Interesting Features for THIS Implementation in Particular

- Uses Zig's `Allocator` interface for idiomatic Zig allocations.

## Performance Comparison

Roughly equivalent to clox (TODO: make charts)
